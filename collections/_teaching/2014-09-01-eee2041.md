This module introduces students to the fundemental concepts that underpin 3D computer vision and computer graphics. 
It also introduces the students to practical implementation of computer graphics using OpenGL.

My role in this module from 2014/15-2021/22 academic years was as a demonstrator. 
During this time I moderenised the practical elements of this course moving from the OpenGL fixed-functionality pipeline to the programmable pipeline in order to introduce students to shaders and OpenGL shading language.
