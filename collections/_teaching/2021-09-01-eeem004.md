This is an individual student project module giving each masters student an opportunity to gain realistic experience in developing a solution to a problem from its inception to a demonstrable result. It provides a framework as well as a vehicle for exercising all key aspects of project work, from project specification, through literature and technology research, leading to project planning, problem solving as well as design and implementation, culminating in performance assessment, project demonstration, and project evaluation. 

My role in this module is to supervise and examine student projects. 
I try where possible to work collaboratively with industry partners on MSc project to give students experience working on real world problems. 
Examples of projects that my students have worked on include:

- Tongue Motion Synthesis for Character Animation (collaboration with Humain Studios)
- A Immersive Training Framework (collaboration with Surrey Police)
- Single View Human Appearance Reconstruction Using Deep Learning (collabroation with Intel)
- Audio-driven talking head generation
