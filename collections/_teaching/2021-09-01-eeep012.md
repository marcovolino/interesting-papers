This module supports studentsâ€™ development of personal and professional attitudes and abilities appropriate to a Professional Training placement.  It supports and facilitates self-reflection and transfer of learning from their Professional Training placement experiences to their final year of study and their future employment.

My role as a placement year tutor involves regular contact with the student and comprises of three visits over the PTY, as well as pastoral care of the student.
Examples of companies where I have supported students include:
- Airbus Defence and Space
- BAE Systems
- Qinetiq
- Racelogic
- Tactiq Ltd
