The purpose of the Year 3 Individual Project is to prepare students for independent problem solving and independent work in engineering (or other professional environment). Students undertake an extended piece of research and development work on a particular topic over two semesters, and then present the outcomes of this work via a written Final Project Report and an oral presentation. 

My role in this module is to supervise and examine student projects. 
Examples of projects that my students have worked on include:

- 6 DoF pose estimation of vr headsets using machine learning 
- A standalone head tracking module for immersive media applications
